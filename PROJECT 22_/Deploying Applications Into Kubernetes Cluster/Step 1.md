In this project, you will build upon your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture, and begin to deploy applications on a K8s cluster.
Kubernetes has a lot of moving parts; it operates with several layers of abstraction between your application and host machines 
where it runs. So many terms, and capabilities that is not realistic to learn it all at once. Hence, you will be introduced to as
many concepts as possible, but gradually.

Within this project we are going to learn and see in action following:

1. Deployment of software applications using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) manifest files with following K8s objects:
- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Services (ClusterIP, NodeIP, Loadbalancer)
- Configmaps
- Volumes
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims
- 
…and many more



2. Difference between stateful and stateless applications

- Deploy MySQL as a StatefulSet and explain why

3. Limitations of using manifests directly to deploy on K8s

- Working with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) templates, its components and the most important parts – semantic versioning
- Converting all the .yaml templates into a helm chart

4. Deploying more tools with Helm charts on [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

- Jenkins
  - MySQL
  - Ingress Controllers (Nginx)
- Cert-Manager
- Ingress for Jenkins
- Ingress for the actual application


5. Deploy Monitoring Tools

- Prometheus
- Grafana


6. Hybrid CI/CD by combining different tools such as: [Gitlab CICD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), Jenkins. And, you will also be 
introduced to concepts around [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) using [Weaveworks Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/).


Choosing the right Kubernetes cluster set up
When it comes to using a Kubernetes cluster, there is a number of options available depending on the ultimate use of it. For
example, if you just need a cluster for development or learning, you can use lightweight tools like Minikube, or k3s. These
tools can run on your workstation without heavy system requirements. Obviously, there is limit to the amount of workload you
can deploy there for testing purposes, but it works exactly like any other Kubernetes cluster.

On the other hand, if you need something more robust, suitable for a production workload and with more advanced capabilities
such as horizontal scaling of the worker nodes, then you can consider building own Kubernetes cluster from scratch just as you 
did in Project 21. If you have been able to automate the entire bootstrap using Ansible, you can easily spin up your nodes with
Terraform, and configure the cluster with your Ansible configuration scripts.

It it a great combination of tools responsible for different parts of your applications:

- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible** for cluster master and worker nodes configuration
- **Kubernetes** for deploying your containerized application and orchestrating the deployment

Other options will be to leverage a [Managed Service](https://www.adept.co.uk/the-benefits-of-cloud-managed-services-for-business/) 
Kubernetes cluster from public cloud providers such as: AWS EKS, Microsoft AKS, or Google Cloud Platform GKE. There are so many 
more options out there. Regardless of whichever one you choose, the experience is usually very similar.

Most organisations choose Managed Service options for obvious reasons such as:

1. Less administrative overheads
2. Reduced cost of ownership
3. Improved Security
4. Seamless support
5. Periodical updates to a stable and well-tested version
6. Faster cluster spin up

… and many more

However, there is usually strong reasons why organisations with very strict compliance and security concerns choose to build their
own Kubernetes clusters. Most of the companies that go this route will mostly use on-premises data centres. When there is need to 
store data privately due to its sensitive nature, companies will rather not use a public cloud provider. Because, if they do, they
have no idea of the physical location of the data centre in which their data is being persisted. Banks and Governments are typical
examples of this.

Some setup options can combine both public and private cloud together. For example, the master nodes, etcd clusters, and some worker
nodes that run stateful applications can be configured in private datacentres, while worker nodes that require heavy computations 
and stateless applications can run in public clouds. This kind of hybrid architecture is ideal to satisfy compliance, while also 
benefiting from other public cloud capabilities.

Deploying the Tooling app using Kubernetes objects
In this section, you will begin to write configuration files for Kubernetes objects (they are usually referred as manifests) in the
form of files with yaml syntax and deploy them using kubectl console. But first, let us understand what a Kubernetes object is.

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of 
your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

1. What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
2. The resources available to those applications
3. The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance

These objects are "record of intent" – once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that the 
object exists. By creating an object, you are effectively telling the Kubernetes system what you want your cluster’s workload to 
look like; this is your cluster’s desired state.

To work with Kubernetes objects – whether to create, modify, or delete them – you will need to use the Kubernetes API. When you use
the kubectl command-line interface, for example, the CLI makes the necessary Kubernetes API calls for you. It is also possible to
use curl to directly interact with the Kubernetes API, or it can be as part of developing a program in different programming languages.
That will require some advance knowledge. You can read more about [client libraries](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/) 
to get an idea on how that work
